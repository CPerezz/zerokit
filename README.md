# Zerokit

A set of Zero Knowledge modules, written in Rust and designed to be used in other system programming environments.

## Initial scope

Focus on RLN and being able to use Circom based version through ark-circom, as
opposed to the native one that currently exists in Rust.

## Acknowledgements

- Uses ark-circom, Rust wrapper around Circom.

- Inspired by Applied ZKP group work.

- RLN library written in Rust.
