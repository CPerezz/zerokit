# Semaphore example package

This is basically a wrapper around/copy of
https://github.com/worldcoin/semaphore-rs to illustrate how e.g. RLN package
can be structured like.

Goal is also to provide a basic FFI around protocol.rs, which is currently not
in scope for that project.

See that project for more information.
